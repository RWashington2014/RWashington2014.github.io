When I think back to why I wanted to get into software development, it's a roundabout way which starts as a child.  My Dad bought my siblings and I a Tandy 1000 computer back in the late 80s early 90s.  I would say the passion for Technology started with the games that people and companies could develop using the Technology.
		 
Games such as King's Quest and Police Quest, I thought was so cool and advanced for the time. I thought that this field would be something I wanted to get in to.  Fast Forward some years and I'm studying Computer Engineering in college.  Initially learning C++ and Java.  In school I'm learning that software development is a large field that encompasses many different things.  After graduation  it was tough finding a job in my field and since then I have worked in Telecommunications, Financial Services, and Trucking and Logistics.  
		 
Still wanted to code and be a developer as a career I started looking into ways to continue on in something I enjoy.  A friend of my was enrolled in FlatIron.   I asked her some questions about the program and curriculum and decided that this program can help me acheive my goals.  So here I am!
